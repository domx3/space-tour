# ðŸš€SPACE TOUR

For my second Three.js project I made a website that invites you to
embark on a captivating journey through the celestial wonders of our planetary neighborhood.

- Scroll/slide through our solar system
- Interact with planets along the way
- Learn three interesting facts about each planet
